        Millions experienced severe disruption as record-breaking winds <br>
        from Storm Eunice caused death and injury, huge structural <br>
        damage, transport chaos and widespread power cuts. <br>
        Four people were confirmed to have died in the UK and Ireland by <br>
        Friday evening. The Met Office said a wind speed of up to 122mph <br>
        was recorded at the Needles on the Isle of Wight on Friday, <br>
        provisionally the highest ever in England, and described the <br>
        storm as the worst since the Burn’s Day storm 32 years ago in <br>
        which 47 people died. <br>
        About a third of the UK population – about 20 million people – <br>
        were told to stay at home as the Met Office imposed two rare red <br>
        warnings for much of southern England, south Wales and London. <br>
        The disruption closed thousands of schools and businesses. About <br>
        435,000 homes were left without power early on Friday evening. <br>
        Hundreds of train services and flights were cancelled, and major <br>
        roads closed. <br>
